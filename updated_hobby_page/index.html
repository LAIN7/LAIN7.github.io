                    I am currently finishing up my first (or was it second?) year at OTC, with a plan of getting an Associated degree in Computer science.
			         Eventually I will transfer to MSU or a different university to continue on to a Bachelors degree, and perhaps even further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in things like computer science and electrical engineering, but I also do a lot of reading, writing, drawing, and painting. I am 19 years old and grew up in Washington state, only recently (in the last two years or so) moved to Missouri. So far My expereinces here have been alright, and I am excited to continue learning at OTC.
