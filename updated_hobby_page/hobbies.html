                <h1>Drawing And Painting</h1>
                <p>During my free time I like to draw and paint, using both traditional and digital mediums</p>
                <h3>Recent Pieces</h3>
                <img src = "oil.jpg" alt="oil painting">
                <img src = "planet.jpg"  alt = "digital painting">
                <p>
                    At this point, I think I somewhat consider myself an artist as I have spent the last 2 years (and then some!) drawing and painting every day. I started just because I wanted to prove to myself that nothing was out of my reach if I put the effort into it. And I proved myself right.

                <h1>Reading and Writing</h1>
                <p>
                    I also like to do quite a bit of reading a writing. Although my writing skills are not very great, I do try to occasionally write a story, and I hope to one day publish a book.
                </p>
                <p>Some recent books i've read are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enders Game by Orson Scott Card</li>
                    <li>The Art of War by Sun Tzu</li>
                    <li>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain</li>
                    <li>The Time Machine by H.G Wells</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Lately I've been trying to read some of the classics and books I've been reccomeneded in the past. Although I do not have much time to read at home, I make up for it by listening to audiobooks

                <h1>Computers And Etc</h1>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy learning about computers, programming, and hobby electronics. I like to mess around with stuff like Arduino/Raspberry Pi's.
