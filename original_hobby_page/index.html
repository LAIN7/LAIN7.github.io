			<p> I am currently finishing up my first (or was it second?) year at OTC, with a plan of getting an Associated degree in Computer science.
			Eventually I will transfer to MSU or a different university to continue on to a Bachelors degree, and perhaps even further.
			<br></br>
			I am interested in things like computer science and electrical engineering, but I also do a lot of reading, writing, drawing, and painting. 
			I am 19 years old and grew up in Washington state, only recently (in the last two years or so) moved to Missouri. So far My expereinces here have been alright, and I am excited to continue learning at OTC.</p>
			
			<br></br>
			Over the summer I took a few classes at OTC, but I made sure to make some time to spend with my family, and we all went to Silver Dollar City. I had gone only once around 6 years ago, and it was as fun this summer as it was 6 years ago.
