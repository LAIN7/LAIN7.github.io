			<p> I am currently finishing up my first (or was it second?) year at OTC, with a plan of getting an Associated degree in Computer science."</p>
			<p> Eventually I will transfer to MSU or a different university to continue on to a Bachelors degree, and perhaps even further."</p>
			
			
			<p> I am interested in things like computer science and electrical engineering, but I also do a lot of reading, writing, drawing, and painting.</p>
			<p> I am 19 years old and grew up in Washington state, only recently (in the last two years or so) moved to Missouri. So far My expereinces here have been alright, and I am excited to continue learning at OTC.</p>
